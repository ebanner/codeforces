    "One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of (n + 1) rooms, numbered from 1 to (n + 1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number pi, where 1 ≤ pi ≤ i.\n",
