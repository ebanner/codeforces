# Competitive Programming

This repository hosts my attempts and solutions for various [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) exercises. I was initially exposed to competitive programming as part of [cs109: Competitive Programming](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs104c/) in the Spring 2016 semester, which I audited. At the time, the course was taught by [Arnav Sastry](https://twitter.com/arknave) and [Jaime Rivera](http://www.jaime-rivera.com/). Each week, they would assign a few problems from [codeforces.com](codeforces.com), as well as a *vanilla* programming exercise that they developed ([`vanilla/`](vanilla)).

Since the course ended, in addition to solving problems from [codeforces.com](codeforces.com) for fun, I also started [a blog](http://codeforces.com/blog/ebanner) where I document my solutions and intuitions for algorithms and exercises.
