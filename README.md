This repository contains my attempts and solutions for various [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) exercises from [codeforces.com](codeforces.com).

I was initially exposed to competitive programming as part of [cs109: Competitive Programming](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs104c/) in the Spring 2016 semester, which I audited. At the time, the course was taught by [Arnav Sastry](https://twitter.com/arknave) and [Jaime Rivera](http://www.jaime-rivera.com/). Each week, they would assign a few codeforces problems, as well as a *vanilla* programming exercise that they wrote (see [history](https://github.com/ebanner/codeforces/tree/e7af358aa80931c5bbe8a78f090198a393881b63/vanilla) from this repo), which highlighted a technique from that week's class.

Since the course ended, in addition to solving problems for fun, I also started [a blog](http://codeforces.com/blog/ebanner) where I document my solutions and intuitions for select algorithms and exercises.
